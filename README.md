## Movix - TMDB Movie Database Project

This project is a movie database application built with React that utilizes The Movie Database (TMDB) API. Users can browse a collection of movies, view details like ratings, release dates, and synopses, and search for specific titles.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

-   Node.js installed on your machine
-   An internet connection to fetch data from the TMDB API
-   A TOKEN key from TMDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salmanahmed-chd/Movix.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Movix
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory.

5. Inside the `.env` file, add the following line, replacing `YOUR_TOKEN` with your actual TMDB API token:

```
VITE_APP_TMDB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Usage

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser. You can then explore the movie database!
