## Movix - TMDB Movie Database Project

### Overview

This project utilizes the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie data and display it using React. Users can browse through various movies, view details such as ratings, release date, and synopsis, and search for specific movies.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

-   Node.js installed on your machine
-   An internet connection to fetch data from the TMDB API
-   A TOKEN key from TMDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```

git clone https://github.com/salmanahmed-chd/Movix.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```

cd Movix

```

3. Install dependencies:

```

npm install

```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

5. In the `.env` file, add the following line:

```

VITE_APP_TMDB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN

```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the TOKEN key you obtained from the TMDB website.

### Usage

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```

npm run dev

```

This will start the development server and open the project in your default web browser. You can now browse and interact with the movie database.
